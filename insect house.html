                <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
                <p>An insect hotel, also known as a bug hotel or insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities â€“ particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects. </p>
                <p>Bug boxes provide snug, safe places for insects to hibernate. Full of dark nooks and crannies and different structures, they're great fun to build and brilliantly replicate the kind of features lots of minibeasts and other animals look for in our gardens. They are especially good for lacewings and ladybirds.</p>
