             <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
             <P>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies</P>
             <P>Gemsbok typically feed in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diet consists mainly of coarse grasses and browse from thorny shrubs. In desert areas they consume thick-leaved plants, wild melons as well as roots and tubers they dig out of the ground.</P>
             <P>The meat tastes quite similar to beef but obviously leaner and just as juicy and succulent. It has less of a “wild” test to it than say kudu. The best place to eat this I found was in Namibia, where Oryx are more commonly found</P>
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>Habitat: As one of 3 African species of the oryx genus, the gemsbok, or gemsbuck, can be found on the grasslands or savannas and on flat or hilly country in the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa. They are well adapted to the conditions of their hot, arid habitats.</p>
