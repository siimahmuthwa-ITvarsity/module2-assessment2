             <h3>GORILLA</h3>
             <P>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates.</P>
             <P>Gorillas are friendly except if you go on their territory, hurt their infants and offend them, mountain gorillas will become aggressive only when they feel disturbed and when they charge they react by vigorous bites, thumping, breaking ribs, dragging and if a person is not rescued a gorilla will kill.</P>
             <P>Ultimately, we believe the odds are in the gorilla's favor. However, alone and at night the lion will have a strong advantage. If the lion can get in close enough and score an accurate bite, he could end the fight before it even begins. However, a gorilla is a mighty foe with more stamina and fearsome strength.</P>
             <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
             <p>Eastern gorillas live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda and Rwanda. Whereas western gorillas can be found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Angola and DRC.</p>
