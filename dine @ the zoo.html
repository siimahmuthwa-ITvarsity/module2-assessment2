                <h3>DINE @ THE ZOO</h3>
                <p>Historically, the word dinner was associated with the largest meal of the day, regardless of whether it was served in the morning, afternoon, or evening. The term comes from the non-Classical Latin word disjējūnāre, which is defined as breaking a fast. Supper, on the other hand, is more time-specific</p>
                <p>Lunch – refers to the afternoon meal (somewhere between noon to 2 pm) Tea – refers to tea and snacks around evening time (4pm - 6pm) Dinner – refers to a meal at night (after evening, 7pm to 10 pm)</p>
