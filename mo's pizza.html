                <h3>MO'S PIZZA</h3>
                <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
                <p>Your taste buds are the primary factor in what makes pizza special. Along with sweet, salty, sour and bitter, there is a fifth "taste" called umami. Umami was pinpointed by a Japanese chemist who took his observations into a lab and determined exactly what "umami" was and how it affected your taste buds.</p>
