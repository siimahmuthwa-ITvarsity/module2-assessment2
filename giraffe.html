             <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
             <P>The giraffe is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.</P>
             <P>An American trophy hunter has kicked off another social media furore after defending a recent giraffe kill in South Africa by claiming they were “very dangerous animals”. In one sense she is right – giraffes are big and strong and you certainly wouldn't want one kicking you. But attacks on humans are very rare.</P>
             <P>Yes, giraffes. Those strange-looking herbivores aren't known for attacking humans, but in sad news from South Africa, a man was reportedly killed by a giraffe while out biking on the grounds of a game lodge.</P>
             <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>A truly a unique species, giraffes are found only in sub-Saharan Africa and can reach unbelievable heights. Learn surprising giraffe facts, such as why they need such enormous hearts and how they get by on less than thirty minutes of sleep each day.</p>
