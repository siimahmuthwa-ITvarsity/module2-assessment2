                <h3>WILD THINGS COFFEE SHOP</h3>
                 <p>The purpose of the coffee house does sometimes take on the purpose of the centre of society. Your visit could be to meet up or gossip with your friends, do some works, read a book, entertain, or simply to just pass some time. It can be one place that will be a great meeting ground.</p>
                <p>For example, if you're targeting employees on their way to work, opening your coffee shop in a family-friendly shopping center might cause your business to struggle in sales even if the location generates a lot of foot traffic. You'd be better off opening in an area close to an office park or in a business district.</p>
