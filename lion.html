             <h3>LION</h3>
             <P>The lion is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane.</P>
             <P>The lion has forever been a symbol of strength, power and ferocity. During WWF tours to Africa, seeing the majestic species up-close is sure to be a spine-tingling experience. 10. African lions are the most social of all big cats and live together in groups or “prides.” A pride consists of about 15 lions.</P>
             <P>Lions eat many animals. For example, lions favorite food is a zebra. Other animals that lions eat are wild beest, giraffes, gazelles, buffalo, and elaphants. Some of you may ask why a lion eats so much, that is because lions may not find and eat other animals for a week!!!</P>
             <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
             <p>Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, but one small population exists elsewhere… Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western India.</p>
