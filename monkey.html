             <h3>MONKEY</h3>
             <P>Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.</P>
             <P>They can even use leaves to scoop water up in and drink. Monkeys are like humans in many ways. ... Monkeys have a brain that is large for their size and it is part of the reason why they are so intelligent. They are believed to be smarter than other primates including Apes and Lemurs.</P>
             <P>Monkeys are tree-dwelling (arboreal) simians. They are in the primate order. Monkeys are intelligent, social animals. Most monkeys have a tail, even if it is a short one.</P>
              <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>Monkeys tend to inhabit the tropical rainforests of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia. All primates live in trees, with the exception of baboons that prefer to live on the ground.</p>
